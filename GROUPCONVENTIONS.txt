Issues & Management

**Issues must follow the following structure:**
Headline: User story

**User Story**
//As <role> I want <some goal> to <benefit>

**Description of the solution you'd like**
//Elaborate on solution, if you have one 

**Definition of Done**
//A specific goal/list of goals the solution has to accomodate


**Branches concerning a certain issue must contain the issues number after '#', eg: **
- issue#69
- testing#69
- #69

**When finishing an issue, close it with some comment. **

**At this moment we have the option to link braches and/or PR to issues - whenever merging these, issues will be marked as 'Done'**

**Boards**
        To-Do: 
            Stuff we have to do as a group, but is not specific issues. Thoughts, brainstorm and more.

        Backlog:
            If an issue is raised but there is no immediate way to fix the issue,
            it belongs in the backlog, to further discusion, until a specific solution is found.

        Ready: 
            When an issue has a concrete solution, it should be placed in the ready column.
            Herefrom a member of the team can take responsibility of the issue.

        In progress:
            If a member (or members) of the team has taken an issue upon them, the issue should be placed
            into the "In progress" column.

        In review:
            When an issue has been resolved, it should be placed in the "In review" column.
            DO NOT MERGE BRANCH WITH SOLUTION TO DEV YET.
            A member of the team, who was not invold in resolving the issue, will review the solution.

        Done:
            When the solution of the issue is accepted AND merged into dev,
            it is closed with a comment. (And ends in "Done" column)
