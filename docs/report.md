## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
A large level model is used for language understanding and generation. We have used ChatGPT and Co-Pilot in this project. We used these to expedite the coding in certain areas. 
We tried asking ChatGPT when hitting an error that we could not figure out why we recieved. ChatGPT could actually help finding the error sometimes, making this valueable to us.
Co-Pilot were used on the fly, as we were coding it would suggest what we might write, and often it was right and expidited the coding. It was also helpful, as we could write a comment stating what we want and Co-Pilot will then suggest the code for this. 
We have always been careful when using these tools as they may be wrong, inaccurate, etc. and researched upon information it gave that we were going to use. The way we used these tools it became a bit faster to write code, and sometimes **way** faster to debug!
