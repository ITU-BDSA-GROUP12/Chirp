# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](docs/images/domain_model.png)

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities
The gist of our application lies in two main activities; writing cheeps and reading cheeps. A **cheep** is a short message of 1-160 characters, and is not messaged to a particular person. Each cheep is publicly available for everyone to see, and there is not functionality to direct the attention of particular users onto your cheep. Lastly, the user has an option to follow other users, to get easier access to cheeps written by them. \ref{Authenticated Public Timeline}
The use of our application is defined by a range of tabs, a **cheep box** and two different kinds of users - **authenticated** users and **unauthenticated** users. That is, users that are logged in and users that are not. The two kinds of users differ in the elements that they have access to on the site. 
Below is a screenshot of the main page and then a short description of the different elements.
![Chirp public timeline\label{Authenticated Public Timeline}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITU-BDSA23-GROUP12/Chirp/main/docs/images/public%20timeline.png)

##### Public Timeline
The **public timeline** contains a list of each (non-deleted) cheep ever sent, and is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated users. The cheeps are displayed on pages of 32 cheeps, and the pages can browsed between using the **next** and **previous** buttons on the button of the page.
##### Register
If the user has not registered before, clicking the **register** tab redirects the user to a prompt for signing in to GitHub to continue to Chirp. After signing in with GitHub, the user is registered and logged in to Chirp, and is now an authenticated user. If the user have registered before, this information might still be stored in cookies managed by the browser, and will then not be asked to sign in with GitHub - they will simply be logged in right away and immediately turn into an authenticated user. Once authenticated, the user's GitHub username is also used as the user's Chirp username.
Only unauthenticated users have access to the register tab.
##### Login
The **login** tab does the exact same thing as the register tab - their behaviour is the same in every way.
This tab is also only accessible for unauthenticated users.
##### The follow mechanic
An authenticated user has, attached to each cheep on the public timeline, a **follow** button. Uppon clicking this, the follow button is replaced by an **unfollow** button, and the user will be regarded as following the user that sent the particular cheep.
##### My Timeline
The **my timeline** tab is similar to the public timeline, but here only the user's own cheeps and cheeps written by users that the user is following are displayed. This tab is only accessible for authenticated users, and is only privately accessible.
##### Discover
Let the user of the application be A.
The **discover** tab contains the latest cheep of each user B that is deemed interesting for A. B is deemed interesting if at least two users followed by A are following B. Here, A can browse through users that might be more relevant to A. The discover tab is only accessible to authenticated users.
##### Logout
The **logout** tab turns the user into an unauthenticated user. This tab is only accessible to authenticated users.
##### About me
The **about** me page displays information about the user. It:
- displays the GitHub **username** and **email** used for authentication. 
- holds a **Forget Me!** button that **deletes all information** accisiated with the user, including sent cheeps, from the application.
- displays a list of all **cheeps written** by the user.
- displays a list of all **users followed** by the user.
- displays a list of all **users following** the user.

The about me tab is only accessible for authenticated users, and is only privately accessible.
##### The cheep box
The **cheep box** is a text entry field accompanied with a **Share ðŸšœ** button to send any text entered as a cheep. The cheep box is available on the **public timeline** page and on the **my timeline** page.
#### Sending a cheep
Below, a user flow diagram showing a typical scenario of a user logging in and sending a cheep.
