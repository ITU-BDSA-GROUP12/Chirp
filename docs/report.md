## License
It became clear to us that choosing a license is important to us as developers and to provide guidelines for other developers. This is to avoid legal issues regarding copyrights and to protect ourselves from liabilities. 
It is always good practice to add a license to guide other developers of what they can do with our code.

This is of course even more relevant if the application were to stay and generate profit.

When choosing a license you generally have to choose between permissive(copyright) and protective(copyleft)  licenses, with different protective grades. In our group we have agreed that anyone can re-use our code, and we do not have any other reason to choose a protective license. Therefore we have chosen the MIT license because of its simplisity and broad permissive nature. Our dependencies are all protected by MIT or Apache 2.0 license.
